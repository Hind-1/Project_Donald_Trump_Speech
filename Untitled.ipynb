      "  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Vice President Pence. He's a good guy. We've done a great job together. And Merry Christmas, Michigan. Thank you, Michigan. What a victory we had in Michigan. What a victory was that. One of the greats. Was that the greatest evening? But I'm thrilled to be here with thousands of hardworking patriots as we celebrate the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God. Thank you very much. And did you notice that everybody is saying Merry Christmas again? Did you notice? Saying Merry Christmas. I remember when I first started this beautiful trip, this beautiful journey, I just said to the First Lady, \"You are so lucky. I took you on this fantastic journey. It's so much fun. They want to impeach you. They want to do worse than that.\" By the way, by the way, by the way, it doesn't really feel like we're being impeached. The country is doing better than ever before. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party like we've never had before. Nobody's ever had this kind of support. But this sacred season, our country is thriving and it's thriving truly like it has never, it has never happened before to the extent what's happening now. And by the way, your state, because of us, not because of local government, but because of us, because of the job that we've done. Because I understand she's not fixing those potholes. That's what the word is. It was all about roads and they want to raise those gasoline taxes on you. We don't want to do that. But she's not fixing the potholes. But Michigan's had the best year it's ever had. Best year it's ever had. And that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from Japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places. Look what's happening. And you know, I don't know if you know this, but probably 10 years ago I was honored. I was the Man Of The Year by I think somebody, whoever. I was the Man Of The Year in Michigan. Can you believe it? Long time. And that was long before I ever decided to do this. I was happy. I had a beautiful life. What the hell did I do this for? But look how we're doing. Do we love it? I love it. But anyway, I was the Man Of The Year and probably close to 10 years ago and I came to Michigan. He said, \"You're still the Man Of The Year.\" Thank you. Who said that? Thank you. So I came in and I remember the speech so well. I said, \"Why are you allowing them to steal your car companies? Why are you allowing them to go to Mexico and to go from China where they come in from China, they build them in China, they sell them into our country with no tax and you lose your jobs, you lose your factories, the companies leave and you get nothing. Why are they lying?\" I asked that a long time ago and we stopped it. We've stopped it. And you see that. And we just made the USMCA. We're getting rid of NAFTA, which I think is the worst trade deal ever. And it's very exciting. It's a great deal. It's a great deal. It's going to stop exactly what we were just talking about. It makes it very, very prohibitive. They can do it, but they've got to pay a hell of a big price to do it. And history has proven that stops them. But we have a great USMCA that we negotiated with Mexico, with Canada. Now, from the standpoint of the farmers, you know what's going on. We had tremendous trade barriers in Canada. We had attacks on dairy products, 297% tariff, nobody talked about it, with Canada. And we had some really bad things with Mexico. We now have a wonderful deal. And if we didn't have a good deal, you know what I would have done what? What? I would have put tariffs on both countries and that would have been it, right? That would have been it. Unfortunately the deal's been sitting with Nancy Pelosi for a long time and what happened? And she had a lot of pressure, especially from manufacturing areas, farm areas, a lot of pressure to sign it. So here's what happens. So I get along with labor. I had a lot of union labor vote for me, tremendous amount of labor. In New York where I come from, we have a lot of unions. And that's okay. That's fine. So we left a little stuff for the union because we figured to get it signed, we'll give a little bit and we did it and we have one great deal. And now you have the Democrats trying to take credit for this deal and that's okay. Whatever it takes. For seven months, it sits. They don't do anything. We give. And by the way, I spoke to the unions the day before I say, \"Fellows, you got to get it done.\" And union labor loves me and I love you too sir. I love you too sir. So we have a great deal with Mexico, with Canada. And it is true. I say it out loud because I say it to them right now. If they ever wanted to break the deal, that's okay. If somebody wants to break a deal with me, you always have to have an alternative, right? And this country, the deals we made, we did a deal with South Korea. That's great. We did a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollar deal with Japan. It was just a little piece of a deal. Okay? That was a piece of a deal. And I said to Japan, \"Look, you got to make this deal or we're going to put a 20% tariff on the cars. And that's more money than anything we're talking about.\" That's all right. That's all right. That's all right. Get her out. Ger her out of here. Oh well. You're about to hear the greatest speech you've ever heard. And that's going to be the publicity because all the fake news back there will say massive riot… Massive riots. Fake news. But seriously, look, look, look, they won't say it. They won't say it, because when we have protesters all in favor, they don't talk about it, but there's a slob. There's a real slob. Wait, wait a minute. She'll get hell when she gets back home with mom. But she made… Look, she screams a little bit. And you know what I like to do? Avoid them. Because I'll tell you the big problem. I could hardly hear her. What happens is all of you people go crazy. Look, look, look, and the place. Okay, so there's one disgusting person who made… Wait, wait, who made a… I wouldn't say this, but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger right? Now they won't say that, the fake news, they won't say it. If one of us did that, it would be like the biggest story ever. I think it's terrible. And I'll tell you the other thing, I don't know who the security company is, but the police came up, but they want to be so politically correct so they don't grab her wrist lightly and get her out. They say, \"Oh, would you please come? Would you please come with me?\" Sure. \"Ma'am, would you?\" And then she gives the guy the finger and he, \"Oh, Oh.\" You got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks. And they… . Making another group of tariffs, seven and a half percent. This gives us a lot of currency to do the phase two deal, which they want to start, but we're taking in billions of dollars and to help the farmers who were targeted, 16 billion and 12 billion the previous year, helps the farmers. So you know what we do, out of that big check that we get, all that money flows into the treasury. Out of the big check, we gave the farmers 16 billion dollars and 12 billion for the previous year. And you know, the incredible thing, and I was with a lot of farmers. I was with a group of 36 farmers at the White House. You know what they said to me? I said, \"Don't worry about it. We're going to take care of you guys.\" And I used a bad word. You know what word I used? We're going to get you a subsidy. And they said this two years ago, I said, \"How much were you targeted for?\" This was the first year. \"12 billion, sir.\" The second year was 16. They were target. That's what they didn't get from China. So I said, \"It's all right, we're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're going to have billions and billions of dollars left over.\" And they said, \"Sir, we don't want money. We just want a level playing field.\" I've never seen that before. I've never seen that before. So we will have invested in our military, since I'm here, which is less than three years. Our military, by the way, in all due respect to the previous two administrations, our military was depleted. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. We had fighter jets that were 35 years old. We had planes that were 60 years… You heard where the father flew them, the grandfather flew them, and now the young son comes in. We've got the best equipment in the world now. Spent two and a half trillion dollars, made in the USA. Two and a half trillion. We will shortly. That'll be all finished. We're going to have the greatest… Now we have the best planes. We're going to have the best ships. We're building a lot of ships now. We're building the most powerful weapons in the world. Now, we don't want to even talk about it. We never want to use them. But you know, the way we're not going to have to use them is if we have them. We're building submarines, the power of which nobody's ever seen before. Nobody's ever seen before. It's funny, we have these companies come in. I like to make good deals. You like to make good deals. That's what we do, right? So these really countries that come in, prime ministers, presidents, sometimes dictators, those we can't deal with too much. \"Sir, we'd like to buy a nuclear submarine.\" I say, \"No thanks.\" I turn them all down. You have no idea how many people… But we're building some of the… They're the most powerful weapons ever made by man or womankind. I say mankind and womankind. They can definitely fight. They're the real deal. These guys, so good looking. I said, \"You could be a movie star. Go to Hollywood.\" \"No sir. I like doing what I'm doing.\" So I said to these guys, you going to see, just like central casting, I said, I said, \"Fellas, how good is this plane?\" They said, \"Sir, it's great.\" \"Why?\" \"Because the enemy can't see it.\" That helps. Stealth. It's actually called super stealth. So I said, \"You mean they can't see, so you shoot at them but they can't…\" He said, \"They have no idea where we are, sir.\" I said, \"That sounds good to me.\" Nobody does it. Nobody can do it. We have the whole thing and we bought in a lot of those planes, we bought in a lot of great stuff. And I won't tell you the story, but very early on I thought we were going to have a problem someplace, and one of the generals came up to me and said, \"Sir, don't go. Don't do it.\" \"Why?\" \"We don't have the ammunition.\" And I said two things. I never want to hear a President. Right? We never want to have a President hear that again, nor do we want a President to have to go through the crap that we were going through back then. But, another thing we did, which to me is such an incredible thing to have done. It's such an honor. So our last US Armed Forces, the last branch was the Air Force, right? That was many, many decades ago. We are now building and we have now gotten funding for the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, The Space Force. So I'll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else, \"See that Space Force? That was my baby.\" And you think that was easy? That's not easy. Because you have Democrats that do not like our military. They do not like our military. And we did something yesterday, because for three years I would see people that run… Incredible people, the heads of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country. And every year they'd come in and they'd be looking for help. They needed help and they do need help with it and it's great and they do an incredible job. So many great schools, but they need help. And every year they'd have to come and come. I got to know them actually. I said, \"The only bad thing is you won't see me too much anymore.\" Because we just provided record funding for a nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And it's longterm, they're not going to have to come. So I said, \"Look, we could do it where we do it every year or we'll do what we have. What do you want?\" They said, \"Let us just have it.\" So we'll miss them. But they are great people. They've done an incredible job. And our extraordinary jobs boom, which created another 266,000 jobs last month, and then you add the undercount from the previous two months, you're close to 300,000 jobs. And they said, if you're a business watcher which I am, I love watching business, but they said they were guessing, could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said. Then the number comes out, 266,000 with an adjustment. Remember about four months ago when we had one little period, right? We had one little period where there was a little downturn. They said, \"Oh, Oh, we think we're going into a recession.\" I said, \"Don't worry about it.\" \"We think we're going into a recession.\" They were willing to lose their wealth. They were willing for this stocks and whatever the hell they own, what do you guys own back there? Let it go. They'll go bust. They don't care. Anything to get rid of us. Not me, us. And you know what? Then all of a sudden, and now for the last couple of weeks, we've set brand new records in the history of the various stock markets. So, as of yesterday, we've had 133 record days in the stock market now, and that's in less than three years. So when I see that I don't care because I don't… I'm not allowed to have stock. I can't have stock. They consider it a conflict of interest and that I can understand. I agree. I can. But you know what? I'll tell you what. What I see, I see tremendous job growth because we're setting records. But you know what I also see? The 401ks where people are up 90%, they're up 97%, they're up 82%. I tell you the story all the time. I mean, I have people coming up to me, and a man came up, a policeman. I've told this story, but I've had many, so many times, but this guy in particular, because it was early and that was a year ago. That was a long time ago. Right now it's much higher than that. But he said, \"Sir, I want to thank you. My wife thinks I'm a loser. All my life, we never did well with the 401ks, with stocks. Everything I invested, I'm up 72%, sir. She thinks I'm a financial genius. She's so in love with me. She so in love.\" He said, \"She said, ‘Darling, I think you're one of the greatest investors. Why don't you do this professionally?' And I don't even know what I'm doing, sir. I just have all these stocks.\" So I just wanted to tell you, I look at a 401k, who has 401ks here? So that's what I see. I don't care about the rich ones. I care about everybody. I care. I care about everybody actually. Ford motor company just announced that it is investing 1.5 billion dollars into auto factories in the Detroit area, creating another 3000 Michigan jobs. And that's on top of the many other investments we've gotten from Japanese companies, car companies, and other companies. But they're all coming in and a lot of them are coming to Michigan. And I say, \"Hey, go to Michigan.\" Sometimes they'll go south and that's okay, whatever. I want them in this country. But ideally I want to fill them up. We're doing so well in Michigan with the auto companies. Now you're back. You're back. So, you're back. Very proud of you. Very proud of you. But while we're creating jobs, fighting for Michigan workers, and achieving numbers that you've never seen before, incredible victories for the American people are happening. The radical left in Congress is consumed with hatred and envy and rage. You see what's going on? I'll tell you, these people are crazy. You ever hear, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" You know that was Clinton's saying. If you have a good economy. I have the greatest economy in the history of this country and nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. If you're a Democrat, they say, \" Oh, it's the economy…\" If the economy's any good. And let me just tell you a little secret. If crooked Hillary would've won, your economy would have crashed. You were going down. The regulations were taking it down. The taxes were taking it down, instead of being up 92% or whatever you're up, a lot, you would have been down, you would have been at less than half. It was crashing. For all those people that would say, \"Oh, it's the Obama…\" Let me tell you something. You were dying. And if you look at that first period of a couple of months, it was a disaster, but it was heading south. And as sure as you're standing, and I'm sorry we couldn't get you seats, we didn't have any room. And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. You know? It's so cold outside we told them, \"Don't worry about a screen, go home, go home and watch.\" But we had, this is about a 5,500 seat arena. And I said to my people, \"Why so small?\" Are we spoiled? I watch these guys come in like Biden, he has a big rally and they get 93 people show up. No, it's true. I don't understand it. And did you see the new polls from USA Today came out? I'm killing everybody. And they hate me. USA Today hates me. But there's a poll, we're beating everybody. But, so Biden has this rally, they've got 200 seats, but only a small number of people. So you know what they do? They set up a round table. So think of these people. They come in, they think they're going to listen to the speech, they end up sitting on a round table discussing… They must've been happy, right? We don't have enough room for round tables. I'm sorry folks. No, they set up a round table but I think we're doing great. And how do you beat what we've done? With the economy, with our great vets, with choice. You've finally got choice. They've been trying to get it for almost 50 years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. And these people back here? Your seat or stand is better. Right? But you know what? They're going to be much more famous because the cameras can't see you. They can only see them. And the other thing, the cameras, do you ever notice, I go to these stadiums, 25, 30,000 people. They never show the crowd. You know why? Because they don't want to have… If crazy Pocahontas, if crazy Pocahontas goes to the middle of Central Park or whatever. She's in Manhattan. You got me. And people, I mean, I could have, I could have Baron Trump go into Central Park and he'd get a crowd that would be just as… He's 13. He'd get a bigger crowd. But if she has the crowd, \"Oh, these crowds are so big.\" I've had crowds over the last couple of weeks. We went to different Pennsylvania, Florida. But I mean thousands and thousands of people can't get into these NBA arenas, right? Big arenas. And we set records at everyone because we use the floor. Thank you. I appreciate it. But we use the floor, right? The basketball court. So we set records at every arena. They never even mention the crowds. They never mention the crowds. It's sort of amazing. You know what? I don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator. That's a long time ago. I don't think we've ever had an empty seat. Now what the crooked media does though, if you got like over here, look how packed it is and there's thousands outside, but I… \"Please go home. You're going to catch pneumonia.\" But here's the thing. If this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say \"Trump wasn't able to fill up the arena.\" I always get nervous when I see some… I know they're coming back. Nobody ever leaves our speeches. Because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally? But every time I see a man get up, I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they're getting up. The baby's going crazy and they're getting up. They're going to take it… But I know they're going to be right back. And I say, \"Fill those two seats. I don't want them to see it.\" Because they'll say, \"Couldn't fill up the arena.\" These are truly dishonest people. After three years of sinister witch hunts, hoaxes, scams, tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans. Capped off with one of the greatest election evenings in history. Was that the greatest? Remember when they all said, remember when they all said, \"No, no. You can't win Michigan. You can't.\" Then I went, I did one in Grand Rapids, right? Grand Rapids. We had 32,000 people that night. It was one o'clock in the morning. That means it was Election Day when I started speaking. Hillary, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton, they did an emergency trip. They did an emergency trip to Michigan at six o'clock. They got here at prime time. They started to speak. She had 500 people. I got here at one o'clock in the morning the next day, which is now Election Day. How many people were there? 32,000 people outside, inside. It was the last speech of Michigan. And they say, \"Well, sir, it's very hard to win Michigan.\" I said, \"Why would it be hard?\" Here's the beautiful thing. Everything I told you I've done, but much more so. I said I was going to bring car companies back. I said I was going to bring in… I just hope you people know that. I just hope you know it. But I'll never forget that night. And in all fairness to Bill Clinton, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for office. I like him, I like him. But he told, you know the way they tried to shut him out, right? Because he's a pro. He's an instinct guy, right? He's instinct. He doesn't need… Right? Because he's a pro. He's an instinct guy, right? He's instinct. He doesn't need polling companies. Who the hell wants him? You know, if you want a polling company, pick up the newspaper. The problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. They write fake polls. It's true, they write fake polls. You call them suppression polls. You read them and you get depressed, because it looks like you're doing badly. They do that. I think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write. So what happens is Bill Clinton said to Crooked Hillary, his very dishonest wife, Crooked Hillary. Do you think he calls her Crooked Hillary? He might. Maybe he just calls her crooked? He said, \"Crooked, I'm telling you. Crooked, I don't like what I'm seeing in Michigan. I don't like what I'm seeing in Wisconsin.\" He said, \"I took the trip to Wisconsin and I'll tell you what, they had those Trump/Pence signs all the way to the convention area, every lawn, every loan. I don't like Wisconsin.\" And then he said, \"Oh, don't worry about it.\" What the hell does he know? They told him, \"What do you know?\" Remember, they shut him out at the … They didn't want him talking. He was right. I mean, I don't want to cause any problems in the family, but he was right. But he talked about Wisconsin. Then he talked about Michigan. He said, \"Crooked, I'm telling you, Crooked, I don't like what I'm seeing in Michigan. I was in Michigan and I'm telling you, they had those damn signs. I saw some houses where they had four of them on one lawn, and two of them on the car.\" And he said, \"You horrible human being. You'd better start listening to me, because you're going to get your ass whooped? And you know what happened? You know what happened? She didn't listen, fortunately. And she didn't come to Michigan enough. And she didn't come to Wisconsin, I think at all, right? Because her polling data looked good. It looked good to me, too. Every time I went there with these crowds. So we won Wisconsin. We won Michigan and the great Ronna McDaniel … where is Ronna? Where is Ronna? Ronna, she was so horrible. I didn't know her, Ronna McDaniel, and she was so aggressive. She kept calling and said, \"Could you please come out to Michigan?\" I said, \"Who the hell are you?\" And I said, \"What do you mean, another trip?\" So anyway, I made, we had these big crowds. I made it again. Then finally I said, two weeks out, I said, \"Ronna, no more. We're going to win it or we're not.\" \"Okay.\" 00 in the evening for this final deal in Grand Rapids. \"Sir, could you come to Michigan tonight?\" And I thought, I was just about finished. I went to a last great state, and I said, \"It's over.\" Now I sit back and I watch, and let's see what happens, right? But she said, \"Could you come to Michigan?\" I said, that is the most aggressive human being I've ever met. And we did it. And we won Michigan. And the word is that we're much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in Michigan. You better remember when you walk into … you know, it's November 3rd this time, November 3rd. By the way though, that evening, that incredible evening in November, one of the biggest nights in the history of television. You never hear them say it, so I might as well. That election … and my debates … you see their debates are dying. Who wants to watch Buttigieg, Buttigieg? Buttigieg! You know that you pronounce it they say … I heard some guy saying, \"No, no, because it's an unpronounceable name.\" That's why they call him Mayor Pete, right? Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete! I've had you up to here, Mayor Pete. No, Buttigieg is leading. How does … no, you say it this way. You say it … they call him Mayor Pete, because nobody can pronounce his last name. That's the only … people think it says … by the way, you know what? I'm not going to say bad things about him. You know why? I'd love him to win. I thought I knocked off Pocahontas. I did it a year too early, a year too early. I give her credit, she then started to come back. I don't think she's going to make it though. She's gasping. She's gasping for air. But I saw them pronouncing Buttigieg, and they said, \"Here's what you do, boot edge edge.\" Say, \"Edge, like the edge of a building. Edge edge,\" Buttigieg. Alfred E. Newman. You got to be older to know what that means. But congressional Democrats are directly attacking 2.3 million Michigan voters who rose up in 2016, won the state, and now the Democrats are very upset. They want to get Michigan back. They just don't know how to do it, because they didn't do a thing for Michigan. They didn't do anything for Michigan. All they did was take away your companies and let them go to Mexico and other places. You know, I don't know if you know it, Mexico has 32% of your car business. You know that, right? Not because of me. They're not moving. But Mexico has … 32% of our car business moved to Mexico. Can you believe this? Before I got there, but that's what I used to talk about. I said, when I was honored that night, I said, \"How do you let this happen? How do you let all these companies leave?\" It used to go, … it's probably maybe the single biggest reason I ran for president. It might be the … and I had a lot of them. Immigration, I had a lot of them, but that may be the single biggest. With today's illegal unconstitutional and partisan impeachment, the do nothing Democrats, and they are do nothing … all they want to do is focus on this, what they could be doing … are declaring their deep hatred and disdain for the American voter. This lawless, partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat Party. Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks? It's crazy. It's crazy. You know why? Because people, we have an election right down the road. I announced three months ago that I'm running, right? I'll give you a little clue. I announced because I figured once I announce, they'd never impeach, nobody would be so stupid. But they'd been trying to impeach me from day one. They've been trying to impeach me from before I ran, okay? Because if you remember when I ran, I went immediately to number one, never came off number one. We had center stage from day one in the debates. So we had, I don't know, 14, 15 debates. We had a total of 18, actually. People forgot there was one that they never talk about it, but that's okay. But we had 18 people, and I was center stage. And I said, \"Wait a minute, this is no good.\" I want odd numbers, because of your center stage, if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle. So I said, \"Make it 11 or make it nine, or I'm not showing up.\" And generally they did it, because we were way ahead from the beginning. But I made a lot of great friends out of that group, and many of them are good friends today. Although you wouldn't know it based on the … they say that was the meanest … that was a pretty mean primary, you got to say. Wasn't that fun? I liked it. Through their depraved actions today, Crazy Nancy Pelosi's House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame, and it really is. It's a disgrace. Democrat lawmakers do not believe you have the right to select your own president. They think that the Washington swamp, which we believe it or not, it ain't easy, because they got so much stacked, including these guys. You know what? These guys are apart of the Democrat Party. They are a part of it. You might as well call them Democrats. You know, it's owned by Commicast. They're just as bad as CNN, or they're just as bad as MSNBC. And by the way, CNN and MSNBC, their ratings are down the tubes. It's great. I love it. I love it. But they think the Washington swamp should be able to veto the results of an election. That's what they think. There's never been a time like this. Think of it, you have the greatest economy in the history of the world. Other countries come to see me, all of their leaders, and they say, \"Sir, \" first thing, \"Sir, congratulations on your economy. We're trying to do the same thing. Congratulations, sir.\" And these guys don't like talking about it. And if they do, they say, \"Obama did it. Oh, Obama, Obama.\" Remember Obama said, \"You will never be president. He will never be president?\" Then remember he said, \"I will consider it a personal front if you allow him to be president?\" And then I became president. He wasn't so happy. And in all fairness, he campaigned harder than Crooked Hillary, because he had more strength. I mean, I go to these places, Secret Service, they take me. I haven't seen a lobby in three years. It's true. I go through basements. I pass compactor plants. I know more about compactors from this job. I don't see lobbies. I say \"Fellows, you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby?\" \"No, sir.\" But I'll tell you what. I go upstairs, downstairs, all around. They're taking me up three flights, go down one. I said, \"Are we almost there?\" \"Yes, sir, another four flights.\" And I say, \"You think Hillary could do this? I don't think so.\" They'd bring her back home. She wants to go to sleep. And now I hear she wants to run again. Wouldn't that be great? Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Oh would we love that? You think the Democrats are screwed up? Wait until that happens. Wouldn't that be … Oh, there's my guy. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Well look, based on the FBI report, you just saw what happened with the IG, where they came out with the FBI. Based on that, you know what? I never stopped you. But now, think of what they did. Think of what they did. Think of how dishonest it all was. They shouldn't even be allowed to have an impeachment, because it was based on dishonesty. It was based on illegality. She went out, and they paid for a fake dossier. They gave money to foreigners to write a fake dossier, totally disproven, totally fake. The FBI then took that fake dossier and they used it in the FISA Court to get approval to spy on my campaign. And if we were Democrats, they would've been in jail two years ago. It's a disgrace. Think of what they did. So they use this fake dossier, and they brought it before this big deal court. It's a big deal, the FISA Court. And they said this stuff, and they lied about it, because Comey, who's another beauty … did I do a great job when I fired his ass? What a great job. Oh no, they had bad plans. No, I did a great thing. That was like throwing a rock at a hornet's nest. Did that place explode? And then we learned about Lisa Page, and her wonderful lover, Peter Strzok. I love you Lisa. I love you more than anybody in the world. I love you more than anybody in the world. It causes problems with the wife, but we won't talk about that. Those tapes didn't work well. No, how about those statements, right? And then they say, \"In all fairness,\" … I really liked the report, but how does the Inspector General say … because don't forget, he was appointed by Obama. So I'm not knocking him because he gave us a lot of nuggets, but we had a lot of those nuggets. How does the Inspecto\n",

      "Columns: [There's a lot of people. That's great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's a big group of people. This is on fast notice,  too. Thank you. But I'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful,  great,  hardworking people of this incredible state. You're really hardworking American patriots. That's what you are,  and a lot of people haven't been treated right until I came along. We've done a lot of work and a lot of good work,  and you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year you've ever had. 46 days from now,  we're going to win Minnesota,  and we're going to win four more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees. You know it. You know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You're having a good time with the refugees. That's good. We want to have Omar. He said Omar. That's a beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win? It's unbelievable. Every family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia,  from other places all over the planet. Well,  that's what's happened,  and you like Omar a lot,  don't you? Biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with Bernie,  right? A 700% increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world,  including Yemen,  Syria,  and Somalia. Congratulations,  Minnesota. A 700% increase. Good luck,  Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves,  because if I'm not here,  if I don't win,  I don't know where I'm going to be. But maybe I'll come over to see Mike. I'll come and see Mike. Your state will be overrun and destroyed,  and Biden and the radical Left win. That's what's going to happen. I've been watching it for years. They haven't treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank you. I'll tell you,  these hangers are great. Remember this. It's a friendly protest. Please remember this is not a rally. You're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You're not allowed to go to church. You're not allowed to do anything. The only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets,  burn down storefronts,  blow up stores,  and kill people,  because that's considered a protest,  and that,  they allow you to have. You don't have to wear masks at protests. So I said,  \"We can't have a rally. The most we can have is ten people. But why don't we just call it a protest?\",  because this is a protest. It's a protest against stupidity. Speaking about stupidity,  sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. Think of it. 700% increase. So you're not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He's not too thrilled when he hears this. 700% increase is what they have in the manifesto. Now,  maybe they don't honor it,  but I would say they'll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children's schools,  overcrowd their classrooms,  and inundate your hospitals. That's what'll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions,  jihadist regions. They've already been doing that to you,  haven't they? Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administration's keeping terrorists,  extremists,  and criminals the hell out of our country. We don't want them. We don't want them. We've got enough of them. We've got enough of them. Just today,  we deported,  as you know very well,  dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes,  including rape,  assault,  robbery,  terrorism,  and murder,  of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country,  where they do all the complaining they want,  and your children are much safer as a result. Thank you,  President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden,  and it's not. It's the people that's around him. They are seriously radical Left Democrats,  and they're very dangerous. The offenders are very dangerous,  and they'd be running all over your state. Only by voting for me are you going to say … But I hate to say this,  and get it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things,  and I'll do it for you again. I'll do it for you again. But if you vote for me,  I'm the difference,  and I'm the wall. You know the wall that we're building on the southern border? I'm your wall between the American Dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago,  I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with,  a Democrat,  \"Who's the dumbest senator? Who's the smartest senator?\" He gave me a name for the smartest. I said,  \"Who's the dumbest?\" \"Oh,  Joe Biden. You didn't know that?\" That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for sleepy Joe. They do disinformation. They make things up,  and they make commercials. They make things up. I've never seen anything like it. Everything,  they make up. First of all,  I'm the one protecting your Social Security. They say,  \"Trump\" … Remember four years ago,  they used to say,  \"Oh,  Trump will get rid of Social\" … I have protected your Social Security. They're going to destroy your Social Security. Remember? Did you ever hear of a man,  Fiorello La Guardia? Did you ever? I don't think that happened with him. New York,  I don't think it happened with Rudy Giuliani,  did it? What a great job Rudy did. You realize Rudy's just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great mayor. We polled it. I'd go down about 22 points. They want to poll everything nowadays. I don't believe in polls. They poll everything. But Ali Velshi,  I don't know anything about the guy,  but I know he was standing there. This is really quite a good scene. It's a friendly protest. Everyone's acting … and behind him,  the entire city was burning. It's one of the great pictures of all time. The entire city was burning down. That was your city,  and it's a shame it took so long,  but the governor finally did it at least. If you take a look at Portland,  the governor can't quite do it. She can't get there. I speak to her all the time. \"Come on,  Governor. I can straighten out Portland. Give me less than an hour. Just let us have it for\" … because the state has to ask for it. They have to request. It's a shame. It's such a shame. But in your case,  we went,  and all of a sudden,  it was really … That was going to be a bad night,  too,  right? Remember that,  about seven o'clock? Then you see this guy walked out with about a $250, 000 outfit on. That's because it had more computers and this and that. Got the tear gas deal. He's got the whole deal,  pepper spray,  got everything,  the finest outfit you can buy. Believe me. We just paid for them,  and they were very expensive. So we see one,  the helmet. How about the helmet with the goggles? You can see at night. You can see at day. You can see whenever the hell you want. So there's one. I said,  \"Oh.1,  that's only one guy.\" Then you see another three,  then four. Then you see another ten. They were just getting out of the buses,  coming from very friendly territory. He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas,  and he went down. He was down. \"My knee,  my knee.\" Nobody cared. These guys didn't care. They moved them aside,  and they just walked right to … It was the most beautiful thing, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All I can say is that the fake news just doesn't get it,  do they? They don't get it. They just don't get it. Hello Charleston,  and I'm thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith,  family,  God,  and country. Thank you. It's a phenomenal crowd,  only topped by the number of people outside that didn't get in. If anybody would like to give up where you're standing or your seat,  please raise your hand. All right. Then let's begin,  right? Thank you all very much though. This is great. No,  they don't get it. Down the road,  they have a rally for one of the people that are going to be running tomorrow. They're trying to get to a hundred,  but they're not going to make it. So I think they're going to set up a round table. Well,  that's what they do. So people want to go to a rally,  they end up sitting at a round table talking about their definition of impeachment. Crazy. No,  it's crazy. Crazy! It's a crazy deal. No,  the fake news media,  they've been trying to figure this out for years. They still don't get it though. They don't get it. Look at all of those cameras. Look at all of those cameras. That's a lot of cameras. That's a lot of cameras,  Lindsey and Tim,  that's a lot of… They heard you guys were here. They heard Tim was here and that Lindsey was here and that… And they said,  \"We're not going to attend that rally,  but when we heard those two guys plus our great congressmen, they're here, great congressmen. But this is an incredible time for our nation. We're thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the Great American Comeback and that's what it is. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, factories are returning, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military. Our country is stronger than ever before. We are stronger, we are better, but while we are building a great future, the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down. They have spent the last three years, and I can even go further than that, three years since the election, but we go before the election, working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy. But with your help, we have exposed the far left's corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months. Let's watch. Let's just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they're politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, How's President Trump doing?\" They go,  \"Oh,  not good,  not good.\" They have no clue. They don't have any clue. They can't even count their votes in Iowa. They can't even count. No,  they can't. They can't count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said,  \"Mr. President,  they tried to beat you on Russia,  Russia,  Russia.\" That didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They'd been doing it since you got in. It's all turning. They lost. It's all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early,  we could have had a lot more than that. We're doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now. There has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now. Never been a movement. So a statistic that we want to talk about,  go ahead. Say USA. It's okay. USA. So a number that nobody heard of,  that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear it,  35, 000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? 35, 000,  that's a lot of people. It could go to 100, 000.1,  it could be 27, 000. They say usually a minimum of 27,  goes up to 100, 000 people a year die. And so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared. It doesn't mean we won't,  but think of it. You hear 35 and 40, 000 people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode. CNN fake news and the camera just went off,  the camera. The camera just went off. Turn it back on. Hey,  by the way,  hold it. Look at this,  and honestly,  all events are like this. It's about us. It's all about us. I wish they'd take the camera,  show the arena please. They never do. They never do. They never do it. They never show the arena. You can hear it because when you hear it,  that's not 200 people. That's not a hundred people. That's thousands and thousands of people including people outside. You can hear it. They always show my face. See that face? They show my face. I want them to show the arena,  not my face,  right? How many have you been to? How many rallies have you gone? Practically every one. Can you believe it? I'm sure your husbands are thrilled,  right? They're thrilled. Where are you going tonight? I'm going to another Trump rally. Cool. Number 114. What do your husbands say about that? This group up here. She said,  \"We don't care.\" Thank you. Thank you. Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we're doing a great job. We're doing a great job with what we have to work with. It's incredible. The Democrats want us to fail so badly. Even if their actions,  and you take a look,  hurt the people of this country,  they'll hurt the people themselves,  their wealth,  their everything. They're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad,  even if they know it's not so. We made an unbelievable deal with Mexico,  with Canada,  with China,  with South Korea,  with Japan. And if you put a microphone with these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be,  not anymore. Best movie of the year. It's made in South Korea. What's that all about? I'm waiting to see the best movie of the year- And it's made… He said,  \"It's garbage.\" Only in South Carolina can you say that. Only in South Carolina. You're going to get us in trouble. No,  I'm just repeating what he said for the fake news. No,  but seriously the Academy Awards has gone way,  way down in ratings. Do you know why? Because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore. That's why. No,  but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea. They make enough stuff for us,  right? And they're good. They're our friends. Take advantage of us,  that's okay. Not so much anymore. We are really,  you take a look,  magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world. We're prepared for the absolute worst. You have to be prepared for the worst,  but hopefully it will all amount to very little. That's why I tell you when we have the flu with 35, 000 people and this one we have to take it very,  very seriously. That's what we're doing. We are preparing for the worst. My administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States. We are ready. We are ready. Totally ready. On January 31st,  I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States. An action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying,  \"Thank you very much. You were 100% correct.\" Could've been a whole different story. But I say,  so let's get this right. A virus starts in China,  bleeds its way into various countries all around the world,  doesn't spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,  and the Democrats' single talking point,  and you see it,  is that it's Donald Trump's fault,  right? It's Donald Trump's fault. No,  just things that happened. But you know what this does show you? Things happen. Whoever thought of this two weeks ago? Who would've thought this could be going on four weeks ago? You wouldn't. But things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it. And my guys that we have the best professionals in the world,  the best in the world and we are so ready. At the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We had a quarantine some people. They weren't happy,  they weren't happy about it. I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy,  but after two weeks they got happy. You know who got happy? The people around them got happy. That's who got happy. I also created a White House virus task force. It's a big thing,  a virus task force. I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need. The Democrats said,  \"That's terrible. He's doing the wrong thing. He needs eight and a half billion,  not two and a half.\" I've never had that before. I ask for two and a half,  they want to give me eight and a half,  so I said,  \"I'll take it.\" Does that make me a bad… I'll take it. I'll take it. I never had that before. I never had it. We want two and a half million. That's plenty. We demand you take eight and a half. He doesn't know what he's doing. We want eight and a half. These people are crazy. We must understand that border security is also health security. And you've all seen the wall has gone up like magic. It's gone up like magic. You think that was an easy one? That was not an easy one. It's going up great and we're up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security,  water,  everything. This is everything they wanted,  132 miles already. We'll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometime. One of the reasons the numbers are so good. We will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country. We have no choice. Whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats,  the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [I want to thank you very much. North Carolina,  thank you very much. I'm thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte,  where,  by the way,  we're having our convention. I guess you heard that,  right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country,  cherish our values,  respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now,  we're going to defeat the radical socialists. We're going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time,  we're going to win it this time by even more. And you know,  Eric and Lara named their daughter,  you know what her name is? Carolina,  Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason. This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today,  we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That's great. That's great. That was great. You know,  our opponents were saying,  \" Oh,  maybe he's in trouble,  maybe the economy … \" They'll do anything. They'll do anything. I'm sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don't think so. By the way,  look at this. Look back there,  look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man,  I don't know if Sleepy Joe,  or Bernie,  I don't think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don't have the primary,  we've already won the thing,  you know? I was going to say the you know what thing,  I held it back,  because they'll say,  \"Horrible language. He used horrible language today.\" But we're doing fantastically. There's never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never,  never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie,  and that's true,  he does have some enthusiasm,  but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people,  too. And there's not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he's running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady,  I said,  \" Hey,  he's running for the Senate.\" And today he just said Super Thursday,  he's looking forward to Super Thursday. Jobs are booming in our country,  incomes are soaring,  poverty has plummeted,  confidence is surging,  and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day,  for me and for you,  it's promises made,  promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know,  we look at it,  it's the never ending wars in the Middle East. We're taking our soldiers,  we're bringing them back home. We're not law enforcement. We're bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world,  or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don't want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country. Two days ago,  the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict,  and very close to 20,  we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations,  we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens And all of the things that we've done,  we've wiped out the terrorists,  we've done so much,  and you know what? We're 8, 000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan,  you've got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made,  was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute,  and I know you pay it,  a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. As we bring back our troops,  we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They're not coming here,  and if they do,  bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. By the way,  I have to say this,  you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas,  any one of them,  Sleepy Joe,  he doesn't have that,  so he doesn't have a lot,  he has very small crowds,  but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size,  they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey,  take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally,  but do we have a great time at a Trump rally? My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including,  sweeping travel restrictions. Today,  we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies,  and they're really working hard,  and they're working smart,  and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They're going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they're going to have something that makes you better,  and that's going to actually take place we think even sooner. So a lot of good things are happening,  but we have strong borders,  and really,  our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out,  we're doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We're working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection,  think of it,  keep all of the infection,  let it come in. And we're working with other countries. In all fairness,  look,  it's a problem,  we're working with other countries. Remember this,  over the last long period of time,  the flu,  the common flu,  you know this,  right? From 27, 000 to 70, 000 people get infected,  and many people die. Think of it,  27, 000. You lose 27, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you to Vice President Mike Pence,  and hello Cincinnati. You know,  I used to work in Cincinnati,  a place called Swifton Village. You know what that is? Swifton Village? It was good and it worked out well,  and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age,  and look what happened to all of us,  right? Look what happened. Look what happened. I was watching the so-called debate last night,  and I also watched the night before that was long,  long television. The Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me practically. This morning,  that's all the fake news was talking about. It's all they were talking about. That wasn't pretty. No,  we're doing good. It's great to be back in the state that I love. I love this state. Very special. Very,  very special,  on the banks of the beautiful Ohio River with the hardworking patriots of the American heartland. Thank you,  Ohio. We love you,  Ohio. We've got thousands of people standing outside,  and I asked the officials can we sneak some up along the aisles? Can they sit on the stairs? But I'll tell you what,  this is some crowd,  some turnout. We've sold tens of thousands of tickets. And,  you know what the sale price is? We keep it nice and low. We keep it nice and low. But,  there never has been a movement like this. This is a movement the likes of which they've never seen before,  maybe anywhere,  but certainly in this country. They've never seen anything like this before. You came from the mountains and the valleys and the rivers,  and you came for … I mean,  look,  from wherever you came from. There were a lot of you. And,  they showed up on election day. I'll never forget,  a wonderful congressman from Tennessee. They have early voting,  and one of the earliest places,  great state,  Tennessee,  and he was in Pennsylvania with me,  great state. And he said,  \"You know,  sir,  I've been doing this for a long time,  but I've never seen people like this show up for early voting. People that haven't voted in a long time because they didn't see anybody they wanted to vote for.\" He said,  \"I've never seen it. They have Trump banners,  and Trump hats,  and Trump buttons. I've never seen it.\" This great congressman said,  \"I don't know,  sir.1,  but I can tell you one thing. If the rest of the country is voting like Tennessee is voting,  you're going to win by a lot.\" And,  we won,  and we won by a lot. We won by a lot. Our nation is stronger today than ever before. The number one economy on earth. No economy is so strong. We're rebuilding the awesome might of the United States military,  and soon it will be stronger relatively speaking than at any time in our history,  and when we took over,  it was depleted. We took over a depleted military. It's not depleted anymore,  I can tell you that. Our spirit is strong. Our stride is back and our stand is clear. We are finally putting America first. It's about time. We've created six million new jobs since election day. Nobody would've thought that was possible. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps,  and they're happy. They're happy. 123, 000 more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected. Think of that number. And,  right now,  Ohio is the most successful it's ever been in the history of our country. Thank you. Congratulations,  Ohio. Stand up,  Mike. And,  you have a good governor. I want to tell you that. Good job. Mike. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century and unemployment for African-Americans,  Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans have all reached the lowest rates ever recorded. While Republicans are working every day to build up our country,  the rage-filled Democrat Party is trying to tear America apart. The Democrat Party is now being led by four left wing extremists who reject everything that we hold dear. No one has paid a higher price for the far left's destructive agenda than Americans living in our nation's inner cities. They have paid a dear price. Do you see what's happening? You see our inner cities,  we spend billions and billions and billions for years and years and years,  and it's stolen money and it's wasted money and it's a shame. For decades,  these communities have been run exclusively by democratic politicians,  and it's been total one party control of the inner cities. For a hundred years,  it's been one party control and look at them. We can name one after another,  but I won't do that because I don't want to be controversial. We want no controversy. No controversy. The democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay. Total decay. The Democrats have tax and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them. Left wing mayors and city councils have opposed school choice,  trapping children and failing in government schools left and right. So many of these mayors right now,  you know where they are? They're in jail,  that's where they are. Republicans believe that every parent has the right to send their children to the school of their choice,  but the greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. These open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals,  drain public services,  and flood communities with poisonous drugs. It's tough enough,  and I want to thank,  by the way,  the country of Mexico. They've got 21, 000 soldiers on the border right now. I'm starting to like Mexico a lot. They do a lot more for us than the Democrats do,  right? A lot more,  a lot more. And,  the numbers are way down. You'll see that. Way,  way down. Democrat lawmakers care more about illegal aliens than they care about their own constituents. They put foreign citizens before American citizens. We're not going to do that. 572 people were murdered in Chicago last year. So,  you got a lot of hot people outside,  but we broke the all time record. The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador,  Honduras,  Guatemala. I believe it's higher than … Give me a place that you think is pretty bad. Give me a place. The guy says Afghanistan. I believe it's higher than Afghanistan in our country. Think of that. I believe,  we'll check the numbers and if we're wrong,  they will tell us tomorrow. It'll be headlines. Trump exaggerated. I do believe the rate is higher than Afghanistan,  yet Democrats,  and they've run it for many years,  want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on illegal migrants instead of supporting their own struggling communities. No good,  no good. The conditions in Nancy Pelosi's once great city of San Francisco are deplorable. They're deplorable. Do you remember the word deplorable? Do you remember when Hillary used the deplorable? She used two words. She used deplorable and irredeemable,  right? And only being a politician for a few years. I said what a terrible mistake that she used the word irredeemable,  but it turned out to be deplorable. Deplorable was not a good day for Hillary. Crooked Hillary. She is a crooked one She's crooked. She is crooked. Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame the world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles,  with the tents and the horrible,  horrible,  disgusting conditions. Look at San Francisco. Look at some of your other cities,  and then you have a governor … You have a governor that invites the whole world to come into California. We'll pay for your healthcare. Then you wonder why so many people are coming up. They're coming up because we're the hottest economic country in the world,  but they're also coming up because you have people like that governor say,  \"Come on up. We'll give you healthcare. Come.\" Who wouldn't come up? Who wouldn't come up? How crazy is this? How crazy is this? Schools,  healthcare. Today,  I've a simple proposal for Democrat leaders to support legislation to end illegal migration,  and we will use the vast savings to rebuild our inner cities. That's the way we should be doing it. That's what we should be doing. By the way,  you know, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [Hello Colorado. We love Colorado,  most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place,  beneath the majestic peaks,  that's true,  of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific,  hardworking,  great American patriots. With your help this November,  we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima,  James Blaine,  Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great,  great patriots,  very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago,  but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great,  great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes,  on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening,  and a lot of them. Great people,  great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history,  the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world,  that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody,  but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security,  we don't worry about budgets,  right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old,  it was tired. We have the best people in the world,  but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address,  I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades,  the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today,  just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate,  it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do,  is it? It's not easy,  Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now,  Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar,  did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said,  \"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing,  but he doesn't want to say that. No,  how about that? \"Are you saying I'm dumb?\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true,  you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you,  Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity,  we do,  and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends,  Steve and Ainsley,  and Brian's gotten much better,  he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says,  Lou Dobbs a year and a half,  two years ago he said,  \"He's the greatest since Reagan.\" Then he said about six months ago,  \"He's better than Reagan.\" And then he said a few nights ago,  \"He's the greatest we've ever had.\" I said,  \"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\" He said,  \"That includes them all.\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us,  right? But now he says,  \"Look,  whether I like him or not,  he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No,  but Fox says,  and I don't know,  it's different. It was different. In the old days,  it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay,  we'll win anyway. No,  but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto,  doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto,  he's not too good. She said,  \"I don't like him.\" Nobody likes him. Right now… So you had,  remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired,  right? You remember,  right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy,  but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said,  \"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,  because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, Wait a minute,  I won every debate.\" It's true. And we sent them polls,  poll after poll after poll. Not only won them,  but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll,  they do those polls right after,  three,  four,  500, 000 people,  Time Magazine. I said,  \"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan,  bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh,  someday in 10,  14,  18,  22 years when I'm gone,  when we leave office in 26 years or so,  they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran,  2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife,  who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said,  \"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain,  a supermarket,  right? It's like,  the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave,  it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave,  the New York Times… Thank you. The great Dan Scavino,  the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong,  they're going to report me,  right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in,  but that's us. He walked in for… We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in,  he's smart,  and he said,  \"I just want to congratulate you.\" Small dinner, ...]\n",

I am thrilled to be here deep in the heart of Texas where we just opened a beautiful new Louie Vuitton plant. I'm with the freedom loving Patriots of the lone star state. I love it. There has never been a better time to be a proud Texan and there's never a better time to be a proud American. There never has. Never has. I came from a small town,  Alvarado,  Texas where we celebrated the incredible revival of American manufacturing and we opened up some beautiful places. I'll tell you,  this place is doing great and created in a very short period of time an extra 1000 jobs for Texas. Since my election,  we've created 775, 000 new jobs across your state including 70, 000 Texas manufacturing jobs. They said those jobs had disappeared,  didn't they? Huh? Hey man,  our country is once again living by two simple rules,  buy American and hire American. The economy is booming. Our people are prospering. Our country is thriving and our nation is stronger than ever before. But the more America achieves,  the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. Crazy. They're crazy. They're crazy. At stake in this fight is their survival of American democracy itself. Don't kid yourself. That's what they want. They are destroying this country but we will never let it happen. Not even close. For three straight years,  radical Democrats have been drawing to overthrow the results of a great,  great election. Maybe,  maybe the greatest election in the history of our country. They want to oppose an extreme agenda. They cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box. They're not going to win. The not even going to get … they won't come close in 2020. They know it. They know it. They're not going to win it. They say,  let's see. What's another idea? What's another idea? How do we win this election? You know,  I really don't believe anymore that they love our country. I don't believe it. Crazy Nancy. Think of that. That crazy Nancy. She is crazy. And shifty Schiff. How about this guy? He makes up my conversation,  which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesn't play well because it was perfect. So he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president and we caught him cold. Everybody knew it anyway. See,  we did one thing. You always have to do the unexpected. They never thought I'd released the conversation with the Ukrainian president. I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say. You know,  they say he has immunity. Why would you have immunity for outright fraud? Why do you have immunity? Why? He's a fraud. We're fighting a campaign against leftist,  socialist,  and globalists who want to return to reckless wars,  open borders,  rampant crime,  and totally disastrous one way trade deals. We're changing that one around very quickly. They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy,  military and defense of every other nation in the world but our own. It's not happening anymore. Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens. And you know that's what's been happening. And that's why 2016 was so important. And that's why 2020,  I can never say it's more important,  but you know it's like the roots of a tree. You plant the baby tree,  it's got to catch,  get that extra time. We'll have more tax cuts. We'll have even … I'll tell you what,  we have rebuilt our military. What we've done has never been done before. The do nothing democrats have betrayed our country and that great betrayal is over. We are finally again,  and we've been doing it now for almost three years. Can you believe we've been doing this for three years? Can you believe it? I've been a politician for three years. I can't believe that. I never thought I'd be called a politician. I don't like it. But it is what it is. But we're finally again putting America first. The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it. They want to indoctrinate our children and teach them that America is a sinful,  wicked nation. You see that happening all the time. And I know it from personal experience. What they want to teach your kids,  not good. They come home,  mommy,  daddy,  this is what I learned. And you're going,  oh no,  don't tell me. Let's get them into another school fast. They want to disarm law abiding citizens. They want to take your guns away. They want to install far left judges to shred our constitution. It's not happening. They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians and religious believers from the public square. They want to silence your voices on social media and they want the government to censor,  muzzle,  and shut down conservative voices. You know that. If they didn't hate our country,  they wouldn't be doing this to our country. They wouldn't be doing it because they know better. They know better. As an example,  we're building a great wall along the Southern border and it's going up rapidly. Going up. And you know,  five years ago almost every one of them wanted a wall until I came along and I said,  we're going to build a great wall because they could never get it done. Then they stopped the funding. They made it almost impossible. Few people would've been able to do what we did,  but we got it from here and we got it from there and we got it from all over the place and we're building that sucker right now and it's having a tremendous effect already. Not easy. Highest level. Everything we said it would be,  it's moving rapidly. Although the fake news back there,  they don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. Look at all those cameras. You believe it. Look at all those red lights. Don't worry. I won't say anything bad about your network because a lot of times I get ready to do a number of these phony networks and you know,  you see those red lights go off,  off,  off.1,  off. They don't want their viewers to see it,  but that's okay. I'm not going to say it tonight. I'm going to say you're legitimate media. I don't actually mean that. But you look at that. But look at all those cameras. You know that's like the Academy Awards used to be before it failed. You know why it failed? You know why it failed? Because they came after us. That's why it failed. It failed because they had stupid people saying horrible things about us. Stupid. stupid people. They are stupid people and their ratings have dropped like a rocket. I love seeing it. I'm telling you. Love it. But no matter how hard they try,  they will fail because the people of Texas and the people of America will never surrender our freedom to those people right there. We will stand strong for family,  faith,  God,  and for country. Last week,  a very dumb Democrat candidate for president,  that's the end of him in this state,  pledged to revoke the tax exempt status of many churches and religious charities. By the way,  that was after a few weeks ago. He said,  excuse me,  we're going to take your guns away. That doesn't work well with me. I called him right. Remember the flailing arms? Nobody noticed it. I noticed it. The flailer. You remember he was flailing all over the place. I said why is this guy hot? John Cornyn's going to win so easily. Just like Ted Cruz won. He's going to win no matter what happens. But John Cornyn is not talking about Beto anymore because Beto,  in a few short weeks got rid of guns and got rid of religion. Those are not two good things in Texas to get rid of. I will never allow the federal government to be used to punish Americans for their religious beliefs. I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon,  except in the case of myself where they use it against me. The radical left tolerates no dissent. It permits no opposition. It accepts no compromise. These people are crazy. And it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people. First it was the Russia hoax. Then it was the smearing which continues,  that disgraceful,  disgusting smearing of a fine man,  Justice Kavanaugh. And now they continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing. With nothing. They come after me,  but what they're really doing is they're coming after the Republican party and what they're really,  really doing is they're coming after and fighting you. And we never lose. I'm fighting for everyone who believes in the values,  traditions,  and principles that have made our nation the greatest in the history of the world. And I have to say this,  we are far greater now than ever before. You go back four years,  you go back seven,  six,  eight,  even you go back into another administration,  you go back 10 and 12 years,  where were you compared to where you are right now? We must hold the Democrats accountable for their lies and their corruption. They are corrupt people. And we must show and vote and we have to go out and we have to win this election coming up. It's going to be a landslide and we have to make it a landslide. Today's do nothing democrats,  they don't do anything. Where's the USMCA? Everybody wants it. The Democrats even want it and crazy Nancy won't let anybody vote on it. She's nuts. Today's Democrats believe anyone who opposes them must be crushed. It's not just like,  let's win. You know,  I have to say this. The Republicans said,  I'm not sure I like this because my life hasn't been this way,  but the Republicans play a much softer game. They really do. When all of our stars,  and we have great stars,  when they went to our speaker of the house at the time and they asked for subpoenas,  oh,  let's take it easy. Let's … okay. I mean,  I get that too. She hands them out like it's cookies. Here. Subpoena. I heard a commentator who happens to be standing right there the other day. Doesn't like us at all. But said,  I've never seen anyone hand out so many subpoenas. I have people getting subpoenas I never heard of. I said,  who are those people? Never saw anything like it. It's a disgrace what they're doing to our country. We became,  because of what they do,  not the Republicans and not what we've done because what they've done and what they see. When people come to my office,  which is now the oval office,  which is your office too. Presidents,  Prime Ministers,  Kings,  Queens. I hate to say it. Sometimes dictators,  they just don't like to go by that title. They say,  sir,  congratulations sir on what you've done. Congratulations on what you've done. It's incredible. Your economy is the greatest on earth. And let me tell you it, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard. You just got two of the greatest trade deals,  and add Japan to it,  by the way. Let's make it three,  40 billion from Japan,  USMCA,  all done. China,  all done for the farmers. It's done,  that I can tell you. You're going to have to get bigger tractors and a hell of a lot more land. You've got to produce a lot of product. I don't know if you can,  but,  hello Des Moines. It's great to be with you. I'm thrilled to be back in American heartland with thousands of loyal,  hardworking American patriots. Great people. This November we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street. I mean,  I don't even know. I just saw,  New York Times,  can you believe? Failing New York Times… When we leave in 10,  14,  18,  22 years from now,  the New York Times will be out of business and so will a lot of others. But,  did you see they did a New York Times poll,  I think,  and Sienna,  Sienna,  New York Times of Iowa,  and they have me pitted against every one of the Socialists,  and we're winning by a lot. Everyone. We're beating them all. We're beating them all. We're beating them all. We're beating them like they haven't been beaten before. You know all the noises about their crazy debates,  nobody's watching their debates,  but it's all about their debates. They don't care about the farmer. Everything out here,  they love Trump,  and you should love Trump with what I've done. So,  we're going to win the great state of Iowa and it's going to be a historic landslide. If we don't win,  your farms are going to hell. I can tell you right now. Sell,  sell,  they'll be saying \"Sell.\" No,  we love the farmers,  and we love the ranchers,  and we love the manufacturers,  frankly. You got plenty of that too in this state. The great state,  and you have a great governor,  by the way. You have a great governor. But every day we're achieving extraordinary victories for the citizens of the Hawkeye State. The Iowa unemployment rate has reached an all time low in history. That's not bad. That's not bad. Oh,  let's vote for Pocahontas. Let's vote for Bernie. Let's vote for sleepy Joe. He's falling asleep. Joe,  Joe,  Joe. He always gets the name wrong. How many times has he missed it? He's in Iowa. He says,  \"Great to be in the great state of Ohio.\" They say,  \"Joe,  you're in Iowa.\" You can't do that. No matter how great you speak. If you're Winston Churchill,  if you make that mistake at the beginning of your speech,  it's over. You might as well just wrap it up. There's the fake news. They would just absolutely destroy you. They would absolutely destroy you. You can't do that. You can't do that,  Joe.1,  sleepy Joe,  but you have these guys. You have these people. How about Buttigieg? Buttigieg. They call him mayor Pete. You know why? Because nobody can pronounce his name. Nobody has any idea. Buttigieg. They say,  \"Say edge edge.\" He presides over a city that's failed. It's doing so badly,  in a state that's having the greatest year they've ever had,  and they have a great governor also,  and they had a great governor. You just heard from him,  right? The great state of Indiana,  so I don't see that one. Go down the line. We have some people. Let's not talk about them. What happened to mini Mike? Where is he? He's not running. He's skipping four or five states. Mini Mike. I've had him up to here. More people are working right now in Iowa than ever before. Now think of it. Think of it. Yesterday we replaced a NAFTA disaster with the incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement. The USMCA,  you know when you have a hard time with that one,  memory is a great thing. I've always had a great memory for whatever reason,  but memory is a great thing. Having a great memory,  but sometimes you take little clues. USMCA. Thank you,  darling. I love you,  too. Where is that person up? Look at that. Wow. What a good,  strong voice. But you know how you remember it? The song I just walked in on. They're playing the song YMCA. So,  when you're having a hard time,  gee,  what's U-S,  just think of the song YMCA,  and you'll remember it,  USMCA. It's a massive win for Iowa farmers and workers of all kinds. It's a massive win and it creates some fairness with Canada. It creates fairness with Mexico. Probably the biggest reason that I ran was the unfair trade that I've seen,  and one after one,  China,  Mexico,  Canada,  Japan,  South Korea,  we've made all these deals,  and we have plenty left over. Plenty left over. Europe,  Europe,  Europe is next. I wanted to finish China before we started on Europe. I like to do them one at a time,  one at a time. I'm a very organized person. But weeks ago we also signed a terrific new trade agreement with China that will boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year,  and many other businesses like manufacturing,  banking,  finance,  overall $250 billion,  and you know with the farmers,  because I have a place in my heart for the farmers big. I went and I saw Ambassador Lighthizer's in charge,  he's fantastic. I said,  \"What are you doing? We're getting ready for the final deal. What are you doing?\" He said,  \"I'm putting in $20 billion.\" Because I asked Sonny Perdue. He's great. You know who he is,  right? Secretary of Agriculture. I said,  \"Sonny,  what's the biggest number that China's ever done with the farmers?\" He said,  \"Sir,  $16 billion last year. $16 billion.\" This was two years ago. I said,  \"So,  $16 billion is the biggest,  because you know, they targeted you, and now we're friends with China. In fact, maybe we've never had a better relationship and were working with them very closely on the Coronavirus. We're working with them very, very closely. We only have five people. Hopefully everything's going to be great. They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully it's all going to be great. But, we're working with China just so you know, and other countries very, very closely, so it doesn't get out of hand, but it's something that we have to be very, very careful with, right? We have to be very careful. But I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, I said, Sonny,  what's the number?\" 16 and 12 the year before,  and you were targeted. I don't blame China. Look,  they're smart. They're negotiators. They targeted Trump states. Where do they love Trump? They love him in Iowa. They love him in Nebraska. They love him in all these states. They love him in Wisconsin. They love him. We won Wisconsin. They like him and Wisconsin, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [ Thank you everybody. Thank you and Vice President Mike Pence,  thank you very much. Incredible. And,  hello to Fayetteville. Hello,  Fayetteville. It's great to be here in North Carolina's ninth congressional district with the hardworking patriots who believe in faith,  family,  God and country. Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow you'll head to the polls to elect a congressman who always puts America first,  Dan Bishop. I've just come from a meeting with North Carolina officials representing communities hit by Hurricane Dorian and I expressed the unwavering solidarity of the American people,  we are behind you 100%. 100%. The prayers of our entire nation are with the citizens of North Carolina,  South Carolina,  Georgia,  Florida and everyone else that was in the storms path,  and I will say I was called by the government of The Bahamas and we're helping with The Bahamas. They were hit so hard. They were hit so hard. Who would believe it? We pledged the full support of the federal government through every step of the rebuilding process. And I will say,  North Carolina in our country probably got hit the hardest. That was a little bit of a surprise,  but I know one thing about North Carolina. You can take it and you'll build it quickly and you'll build it beautifully. And,  you'll be back sooner then anybody ever thought and it'll be better then ever. Right? No doubt about it. I also want to give a special recognition to the many non-governmental organizations doing so much to help people recover from Dorian,  in particular,  Franklin Graham. He's a wonderful guy. He's got an organization,  Samaritan's Purse,  based right here in North Carolina and the work that Franklin and his family and all of those that are with Franklin Graham we want to thank them. Special,  great people. Great People. Thank you Franklin. Thank you. Incredible job. He does such a great job. All over,  whenever there's a problem you see Samaritan's Purse and Franklin and his people. We love the people of this state and we will never ever leave your side. North Carolina will truly recover so fast. I know you people so well. Let's not even talk about it. Let's not even talk about it. We're here tonight to discuss the extraordinary progress we're making as a nation and how to ensure this amazing resurgence keeps on going and going strong. In just over two years,  we've taken this big beautiful ship and it's being turned around very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. You know we won the greatest election,  certainly one of them,  but maybe the greatest,  but we won… let's say one of the greatest,  this way I won't be criticized. They'll say,  \"You know,  George Washington had a great election too.\" The fake news right. The fake news. But,  we won one of the greatest elections in history and because of that,  and you would be in big trouble if we didn't,  I can tell you that. You'd be… Instead of going up we were heading in the wrong direction. We have the number one economy anywhere in the world. And every time I meet a foreign leader,  almost every time,  they say,  \"Congratulations on what you've done with the economy.\" I said,  \"I didn't do it. I just set a certain path. The people of the United States did it.\" Number one anywhere in the world. And they tried to do the recession thing. You know,  they tried the Russia thing. That didn't work. They tried many other things. I always say,  \"The media and their partner,  the Democrats.\" I wouldn't mind fighting the Democrats,  but we really have to look at it as a two-some. It's the media and the Democrats. It's one and the same. We're rebuilding our military,  defending our sovereignty and reclaiming our dignity as a nation. America is winning again and America is respected again. They respect America. By the way,  I have about 10 women in the front row and you come from North Carolina and they travel all over the place. Hold up your hands. These are great women. I see them so much,  and I must say they have other things to do. They look rich as hell to me,  I don't know. How many is this? How many rallies have you come too? They can't count. They said all of them except for two. That's a lot of rallies and it all emanates from this area. That's so great. Well,  at least you won't have to travel so far for this one,  right? Thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it. Well,  we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Thank you. Really incredible people. But you know,  we've created six million new jobs since election day and I couldn't say that in my initial rallies because nobody would have believed it. Six million new jobs. More Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. Almost 160 million Americans,  nobody would have thought that was possible. We wouldn't have been able to say it actually. We've now had 13 straight months of wage gains of at least 3%,  so the people that work so hard… You remember I used to say during the rallies before we won,  people worked two jobs,  three jobs and they made less money then they made 21 years before and now wages are going up,  the economy is doing great and jobs have never been better. So importantly,  more than 70 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Nearly 600, 000 Americans entered the labor force last month alone. Think of that. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans just reached another brand new,  yesterday,  all time low in the history of our country. How do you lose that debate? Remember I used to say,  \"Why do you have to lose?\" Well,  now you have the best unemployment numbers,  employment and unemployment numbers,  that you've ever had as African-Americans,  as Asian-Americans,  as Hispanic-Americans. The best numbers we've ever had,  and by the way,  African-American youth unemployment has also reached the lowest level ever recorded in history. And,  the labor force participation rate for women is at the highest level now in 15 years,  and soon will be 35 years,  and soon,  I promise,  will probably end up being better than ever. I can tell you the unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years. So,  I always say kiddingly,  \"I'm sorry I didn't make it historic,  but you know what? It's going to be historic very soon. It'll be historic very soon. And, here in North Carolina, over 230,000 more people now have jobs and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25%. Amazing. But, the radical democrats want to dismantle, demolish, and destroy everything that you've gained, and they will do it, and it won't take that long. And, that's why we need Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy. We need them. We need them going down. We need them going down to congress and helping. But, they can do it. It's also why we need four more years. It has to… See, it's like a plant. We've changed things, right? Keep America Great. We've changed things, but it's gotta grow. It's gotta develop those roots. And, once it does, it's going to be very hard for them to destroy what we've done. Very hard. And, that's really why I consider this election… Look, we had a very, very special day in 2016. It was a very special day. Very special day. It was an incredible day, an incredible month, an incredible year, and I don't know that you can ever compare anything to it. But, I can say this, 2020 is essentially just as important, because they'll try and take it away. Whether it has to do with religion. Our evangelicals are here tonight, and they're all over the place. And, what we've done for them, and for religion, is so important. You know, the other side, I don't think they're big believers… They're not big believers in religion. That I can tell you. You listen to some of them. They're trying, and they're trying put out little statements. They're not working too well. Little statements that are a little bit, sort of, not too good, huh? What is the word we want to use? Yeah, a little… Nah. Nah. They're pushing a little hard, and it's not working. To stop the far left, you must vote in tomorrow's special election. So important. Or, get your votes in early. I think a lot of… Who voted early for Dan Bishop? Good. Well, that's good, but the big thing is tomorrow. Tomorrow is the election, and you'll get out. To protect your family, you must defeat open borders. And, you have Democrat named Dan McCready, and he wants open borders. He wants sanctuary cities. He's not going to protect your Second Amendment. He's doing nothing on your Sec… You know, North Carolina's a very big Second Amendment state. And, Dan Bishop, Greg Murphy, these guys, they're going to protect your Second Amendment. But, one of the biggest issues in this election is, in fact, sanctuary cities. McCready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods. Get out. Go ahead. Go into the neighborhood. Go into… What's your neighborhood. Where do you… What? Rutherford County! Okay. So, how do you feel about having them released, hardened, horrible criminals into Rutherford County? I don't think so. But, your whole state… Honestly… Can I be honest? It's crazy what's happening. This whole thing with sanctuary cities, and you go to California, which is so many sanctuary cities, they don't know what's happening out there. You have people that want to get ride of those sanctuary cities, they just aren't able to do it with the people that get elected. A lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way, a lot of illegal voting. In August, McCready said it was the right call to set illegal alien criminals loose in the great state…\" I'm using the words great state. He doesn't. \"… Of North Carolina.\" With the support and encouragement of McCready,  sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina have released thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities,  and you see it. You see it. The charges against these freed criminals includes sexual assault,  robbery,  drug crimes,  kidnapping,  and homicide. Murder. Why would you do it? Why would you do it? What is it? Explain it. Just recently,  Mecklenburg County set free an illegal alien charged with first-degree rape and crimes against a child. Support for sanctuary cities is disloyalty to American citizens,  and McCready wants sanctuary cities with all of their protections for people that are serious criminals. Tomorrow is your chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left,  and it's gotta be. And,  by the way,  we're building that wall,  and it's going up very big. Very big. And,  you think it's easy to get money when you have the entire Democrat party… And,  they control the House,  and we want to change that. We want to flip the house. We'll get so much. It'll be amazing what we can do for our country. We don't want dangerous criminal aliens roaming free in North Carolina. We want to take care of it. This state should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans,  not for criminal aliens. Our great Republican candidate,  Dan Bishop,  will fight with everything he has to stop sanctuary cities and defend the people of this great state. Dan,  come on up. Dan Bishop,  everyone. Get out and vote. Come on up,  Dan. We need a doctor. A doctor in the house,  please. A doctor,  please. Doctor in the house. Thank you. Take your time,  please. Take your time. We've got plenty of time. Thank you. Take your time. Thank you,  Doctor. Take your time. People have been standing outside for two days to get in,  so this happens. Thank you. Thank you,  Doctor. Doing better? Good. That's good. That's good. That's great. That's really great. Thank you! Thank you,  sir. Thank you. That's really great. Thank you very much. I guess Dan's speech wasn't so good. What do you think? That's great. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [What a crowd,  what a crowd. Get those people over here. See me. Let them come over. What is a big crowd,  it's always big. We want to win. We got to win. We want to save our country from the radical left,  the radical left crazies. Thank you very much. And hello,  North Carolina,  hello,  North Carolina. We love you,  North Carolina. I'm thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal,  hard working American patriots. And you know what's going to happen in 45 days from now,  and you're watching those polls. They go up,  up,  up up. 45 days from now,  we're going to win North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. As we meet tonight,  our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her landmark rulings,  fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans. You may agree. You may not disagree with her,  but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people. I say,  all Americans Justice Ginsburg's close relationship with a friend of ours,  a friend of mine,  Justice Scalia,  is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency,  dignity,  and respect. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you very much. So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court. I don't think it can be any more clear,  can it? I don't think so. I don't think so. What do you think,  Thom? Thom Tillis,  I don't think it can be any more clear. This can only happen in North Carolina. I hope you hear that back home. Look at all that press. That's a lot of press. That's a lot of fake news. Well,  I hope they hear. So the chant,  this is a new one. Fill that seat. This is the chant. This can only happen to me. Fill that seat. Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat,  right? And that's what we're going to do. We're going to fill the seat. With a great hat. I want to try one of those hats. I love that. No,  think of it. 29 times,  every single time nobody said,  \"Oh,  let's not fill the seat.\" We won the election. Now then we have some senators that,  forget it. Think of it,  I won't say it. I won't say it,  Susan. I won't say it,  Susan. But Thom Tillis is with us. I can tell you that. Great. We have great Republican senators. We have great people and we have a great country. That's really,  we have a great country. And we're going to keep it that way. So we win an election and those are the consequences. It's called fill that seat and that's what we're doing. The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where,  by the way,  I didn't run. We had a lot of people,  a lot of people said,  \"Oh.1,  he really took a little bit of a shellacking.\" Not nearly as bad as others. In fact,  we gained seats in the Senate,  but they never talk about that. They don't talk about that. We gained two seats. Nobody talked about it. But we didn't run. And I had a lot of people that,  \"Sir,  we'll never vote in 2018.\" I said,  \"No,  no vote,  everybody vote. They just didn't. I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they've waited and you see what's going on. You see what's happening. You see the enthusiasm that we have. Which,  by the way.1,  we set a record in 2016. The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now. Not even close,  than we were in 2016. We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner of the pandemic. But we're having them outside. And we shouldn't say this is some kind of a rally from now on. It's called a protest. We are protesters. We're going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these,  let's call them blue states,  we want to be nice. We're going to call it a protest against stupidity. So we are going to have protests against stupidity. And Pennsylvania. Look what they're doing in Pennsylvania. A great state,  that's actually something very special is going to happen here,  in Pennsylvania. That's a commonwealth. We always have to remember Pennsylvania,  commonwealth. Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble. But we love Pennsylvania. And it's a shut down. The governor's got it just shut down nice and tight. And you know what? On November 4th,  it's going to be opened up. Because they're trying to hurt our numbers. But our economic numbers are so good. They're staggering. They're the best we've ever had. Jobs,  retail,  stock,  market,  everything. And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats. That's all they're doing. On November 4th,  they'll announce,  \"We've decided to open up.\" One of the teachers groups said,  actually,  one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said,  \"No.1,  we're not going to do it. We need to do it. We should be open by November 4th.\" That was not a good thing for them to say. That person I think was fired,  I think was fired. In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections,  the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what we're going to do. We said that if for any reason,  we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court,  we will fill that vacancy. We're not going to say,  and by the way,  we have plenty of time. There's a lot of time. You're talking about January 20th. So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race,  color,  religion,  and creed. I won't be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. It will be a woman unless,  wait,  okay,  let's do a poll. Oh,  there they are. How many of these have you come to? Speaking of women,  how many of,  what is this number one? Like 90,  they're great. North Carolina,  though. I see them all over the place,  they're great. Anyway,  I hope your husbands are okay with it. Are they okay? They're okay. You have good husbands. But we're going to do a vote. So I said,  I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as I'm concerned. If we believed in pollsters we wouldn't be here right now. But we're actually getting very good. We just had a 53 from Rasmussen,  which is very good. Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53. History has shown that when you're at 53 you can't lose an election. Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53? The answer is yes,  when the other side cheats. That could happen,  that could happen. That could happen. You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means I'll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah,  yeah. We'll be leading,  we'll be winning Pennsylvania. We're going to win it easy. We're going to win your state easily. And Deb,  what a great,  she's doing such a good job. But Mark,  just a few months ago,  I've been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know. Really,  I mean really great. Does everyone know Madison? Yes? You're going to vote for Madison? He's great. He's a great guy. But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hair's turning white very fast. But we're doing a job. We're very close to a great deal with TikTok,  TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore. All they care about is fill that seat, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [We brought you a lot of car plants,  Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that,  right? Long time,  it's been a long time since you had all these plants being built,  but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years,  and we're going to bring you a lot more. That's happening. Hello,  Michigan and I'm thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal,  hardworking American patriots. Fifty-four days from now,  we're going to win Michigan,  and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan's jobs,  outsourcing- We shouldn't be smiling about it,  but we've changed it around. Outsourcing Michigan's factories,  throwing open your borders,  dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children's future to China and other far away lands. Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century,  including NAFTA,  China,  and DPP. You know that. Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you're seeing that every night. If Biden wins,  China wins. If Biden wins,  the mob wins. If Biden wins,  the rioters,  anarchist,  arsonist and flag burners win. But I wouldn't worry about it because he's not winning. I don't think he's winning. This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that. The same thing happened four years ago. It was election eve but by the time I got here,  it was late. Some of you are in that audience at one o'clock in the morning now election day. We had 32, 000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton,  Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems. They were supposed to win Michigan,  but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes. They came and I heard about it. They said,  \"Sir,  could you do it?\" I hopped in the plane. We landed at 12 o'clock in the evening. I started speaking at one o'clock in the morning now election day. 32, 000 people. She had 500 people. I said,  \"Why are we going to lose Michigan?\" And we didn't. And we didn't. First time in a long time,  but now we're up in the polls. We just saw polls. We're up in Michigan. I don't know if that's good or bad. I don't know. I don't know if that's good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time,  we won. So maybe we're better off being down a little bit. Hello,  John James. I see you handsome guy. John James,  get out and vote for John. I'm going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job you've done. I have to tell you,  he took,  I saw this group of people that were running,  all nice people,  three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right? I saw them all and I said,  \"Wait.\" With the wonderful invention of TiVo,  one of the greats,  you can play it back. I said,  \"Who was that?\" He said,  \"I don't know,  sir.\" I said,  \"Play it back.\" I said,  \"That man is going to be a star.\" It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter,  and he's a great,  and actually a great flyer I heard the other day,  a great one,  a really good one as opposed to those that aren't so good,  but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said,  \"This guy\" and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly,  if he had a little more support,  he would have won the last time. This time,  I hear you're even,  and maybe even ahead,  and we're going to win with John James. He's a great guy,  but I'm going to introduce him in a second. I'm running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan. We have got a lot of … Last year before the China plague came in,  we have the China plague. Thank you China very much. Should have never let that happen. They should have never,  ever let it happen. They stopped it from going into China,  but they didn't stop it from coming out here and coming into the US,  in Europe and the rest of the world,  188 countries. But it is what it is and we're not happy about it and we're going to remember it. We're going to remember it,  but we had in Michigan and in the country,  the greatest economy in the history of the world,  there has never been an economy. Now,  we're building it again and it's being built fast. By the way,  it's turning out to be John,  a super V. No more V. Now it's starting out to be a super V,  but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America,  not to China,  because if we win,  America wins and that's what it's about. If we win,  America wins. Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs,  he wants to eliminate your borders. He's promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world,  including Syria,  Somalia,  and Yemen,  Biden's pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie,  a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So,  he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto. He's also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans,  overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse,  he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way,  the wall,  it's over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder,  the mic louder. Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. You're upper class. You're the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite,  the elite,  they're really elite. I see them. They're not elite. You're the elite. The elite has decided. Boy,  have we hurt the elite,  haven't we now? You're the super elite. The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you. It's very simple. Over the last three and a half years,  we've secured America's borders,  blocked the entry of foreign terrorist,  fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good. They are good. In fact,  Biden was interviewed today on … There they are. CNN. No,  he was just interviewed today. He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy. I don't think he likes me too much,  but that's okay. He was interviewed on CNN and they said,  \"Which is better,  NAFTA or the USMCA?\" He said,  \"No,  no, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Greenville,  North Carolina,  I want to thank you. And to,  Mike Pence,  you've done a great job. Great Vice President. Thank you Mike. And we have all night,  we're going to have a lot of fun tonight,  and I have nothing to do,  nothing,  nothing. We have nothing to do but make our country great again,  and that's happening fast. It's wonderful to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of hardworking North Carolina patriots,  and thank you for your support. Thank you for that very big victory we had three years ago. Time is flying. You getting ready? Let's do it again. Right? Let's do it again. I just heard that the United States House of Representative,  has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I've ever been involved in,  the resolution. How stupid is that? Own impeachment. I want to thank those Democrats because many of them voted for us. The vote was a totally lopsided 332 to 95 to 1. 332 to 95,  think of it,  we have the strongest economy in history,  the lowest unemployment numbers ever,  we've rebuilt the most powerful military,  it was totally depleted when I took office,  and now it's rebuilt. We passed the largest tax cuts and regulation cuts of any president or any administration in history. We took care of our great vets,  including veterans choice,  and veterans accountability. And they want to try and impeach,  it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. So now we have that behind us,  and I have to say this,  and I'll say it just once,  what happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States. Never,  ever again. I want to thank Republican leadership for what they've done for all of us,  by stopping that hoax,  the Russian hoax I call it,  because America is winning again. America's respected again,  and,  because we are finally putting America first. Our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words,  jobs,  jobs.1,  jobs. We've created 6 million new jobs since election day. If I would have said that,  nobody would have believed it. If I would've said that,  the fake news would have said he's exaggerating. And I wouldn't have said it because I wasn't even sure we could do it. Think of it,  6 million jobs since election day,  think of it. And by the way,  North Carolina has had its best economic year in the history of your state. Our country has added more than 180, 000 people to the workforce,  and think of that through what we've done on a federal basis. You picked up over 180, 000 jobs,  North Carolina. Think of that,  and you have your lowest unemployment rate. You have a lot of good things,  but let's not talk too much about North Carolina. Let's win this election nationwide. You remember North Carolina,  that was going to be the Clinton firewall. She spent a fortune here,  and I kept coming in and coming out. They call it,  earned media. I earned it. I kept coming in and coming out,  and every time I left they said,  \"I don't think we'll lose in North Carolina.\" You know what? I was right. We won it. We won it easily. We won it easily. So I just want to thank everybody. Seriously. This is a big… that was a big deal. November 8th,  that was a big deal. Donald Trump has won the great state of North Carolina. A big deal. That was when you started to see the folks at a certain other convention,  beautiful looking place. One of the most beautiful venues I've ever seen,  but I don't want any part of it. It was unlucky. I don't want any part,  but that's when you saw the people say,  what the hell is going on? What? What's happening? And then it was state after state,  it was Florida,  it was South Carolina,  we love South Carolina. Right? Unbelievable. It was Pennsylvania. Remember they wouldn't announce the numbers in Pennsylvania,  so there was 1% of the vote remaining. If I lost every one of those votes,  we still win by a lot,  and they wouldn't announce it. They wouldn't announce it. And then we won the great state of Wisconsin. First time in many,  many decades,  that a Republican won. And then we had a surprise,  but not a surprise to us,  because we're bringing back the auto industry. We brought so much back to the great state of Michigan. That was a shocker,  remember that? Do you remember a certain hand on that beautiful board and they said,  \"You know this sport is getting awfully red.\" That's Republican. \"There's a lot of red up there.\" We had a lot of… That was one hell of a night,  wasn't it though? One hell of a night. I think it was maybe,  you know there are those that say,  one of the most extraordinary and exciting evenings in the history of television and the history of anything. And you know,  you can go,  all over the world in some cases,  it was morning. You go to Asia,  you go to Europe,  you go all over. It was just record setting and here's the point,  we have to do it again. We have to do it again. And the reason we have to not only to do new things,  which we will,  and you know statutorily and we had all sorts of artificial witch hunts over our head. Can you imagine if we didn't have to go through that hoax? I don't know that we would've done any better to be honest with you. I think we've done more in two and a half years than any president ever< first two and a half years. But could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt? You said it. He said it. I won't say it because it's a Harrell,  it's a terrible word. So I will not say that this guy said,  if we didn't have the bullshit,  that's all. No,  no. Could you imagine if we didn't have the time wasted the time and everything. Can you imagine? And you know a friend of mine said maybe you wouldn't have done as well. Is that possible? That can happen. Maybe we would have had too much time on our hands. Who knows? But I can say,  nobody in their first two and a half years has done anywhere close to what we not being what we,  not me,  what we've all done. It's true. The unemployment rate among African Americans is the lowest in the history of our country. Unemployment among Hispanic Americans,  where we're doing really well,  you know why? Because they want a strong border. They want it because they understand the border better than anybody. They want that strong border. They want that wall that's being built right now. They want that wall,  and they really do. They understand the border better than anybody,  and they don't want criminals coming in. They don't want crime coming,  they don't want to lose their jobs. They like the fact that their salaries are going up,  their wages are going up,  they understand it better. So Hispanic American,  the best unemployment numbers in our history,  Asian Americans,  the best unemployment numbers in our history. And likewise women,  74 years. So I'm sorry women,  I let you down. It's not in our history,  but we're going to be there very soon. We're going to be there very soon. Women are doing incredibly and women… the men are going to get angry. Sorry men. Whoa,  look at all those signs. Women for Trump. Wow,  thank you. That's a lot of signs. You remember last election, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [Thank you,  thank you. Wow. Wow,  and I'm thrilled to be here with you in Henderson. Thousands of loyal,  hard-working,  great American patriots. And 51 days from now,  we're going to win Nevada,  and we're going to win four more years in the White House. And after we win four more years,  we'll ask for maybe another four or so. Well,  thank you very much. Whenever I say that … Look at all that news back there,  look at all that fake news. When I say that,  their heads explode. Our movement is pro-jobs,  pro-worker,  pro-police,  and 100% pro-American. As we begin tonight,  our thoughts are with the two sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range. Tonight,  we send our love and our support to their families,  and we pray to God for their recovery. The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement. Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs. You see it,  you see it all the time. Please,  sit down. Please,  let's have a little fun. We got plenty of time. I mean,  here it is. I mean,  what do we have? Football is boring as hell. It's just not the same. Right? I don't know. Used to be people would say,  \"Hey,  could you keep it away from a football game?\" Now they're saying,  \"Could you possibly do it during the football game?\" We have some free time. But during violent demonstrations in Las Vegas,  a 29-year-old police officer,  you know this very well,  was deliberately shot in the head,  leaving the young,  brave officer paralyzed,  yet,  Sleepy Joe Biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police. They're putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm's way. At his convention,  he never even mentioned the words,  \"law and order\",  never mentioned them once. Now,  he's all of a sudden,  his polls are dropping like a rock,  and he's starting to say,  \"But we need law and order.\" And then he goes back into the basement for four days. What happens to this guy? I know what happens to him. He's shot. That's what happened to him. Every once in a while,  the great Dana White … Does anybody know Dana White? He's got some champions with him tonight. He's here. I got to introduce him. But every once in a while,  I'll ask him,  \"What happened to that guy?\" He said,  \"Sir,  he's been shot for the last … long time.\" Should have left a long time ago. That's Joe Biden. Joe Biden,  he's shot,  and everybody knows it. And you know what? They ought to be ashamed,  because they do interviews with him,  they give him the questions,  and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter,  and that's the fake news. It is. How about the other day? Could you move that a little bit closer. See these things? Move it a little bit. I must tell you at great peril,  I used them seldom,  but those are the times we have the best fun too,  I will say. And that's actually when we learn the most. For the entire summer,  Biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers. When Biden's far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations,  court houses,  Joe Biden called them peaceful protestors. Right? They call them peaceful protestors. And when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems,  because everyone … look at the top-10. You go back … go top-20,  top-30. Take a look. Democrat-run,  radical left-wing,  Democrat,  usually run. Not Republican-run,  Democrat-run. And we go back,  and we take a look. We want to give them help. They don't want help. But when they do ask for help,  and when they do,  we go in. Like Minneapolis,  the National Guard went in,  took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks. They knew we were going in to Seattle. We told them,  \"We're going in tomorrow morning.\" And so,  they sent them in. They didn't want that to happen,  and we let the protestors know,  or whatever you call them. They're really anarchists,  they're not protestors. So we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10, 000 very tough people,  and they immediately raised their hands,  and the Seattle police,  who by the way,  could do a great job if they were let to do their job,  but they're not,  they're not. And as you know,  in Portland,  the other day,  we had to send in the US Marshalls. A man,  who's a bad guy,  bad guy,  shot somebody right in the middle of the street,  who they say was a very fine young man. Shot him,  killed him. Just shot him like … It was on television. Two-and-a-half days,  nothing happened. I said,  \"What's going on?\" We sent in the US Marshalls. It was taken care of in 15 minutes. Okay? 15 minutes. When asked if he would cut police funding,  Sleepy Joe said,  \"Absolutely,  yes,  I would.\" Now he's trying to change his mind. You ever see a guy … He changed his mind on fracking. Okay? \"There will be no fracking.\" You know that? He went all throughout the debates. He doesn't even know what fracking is,  I guarantee you. He was told to say that by Bernie and the radical left and his vice president. By the way,  how bad is she? She is the worst. We're going to have a woman president some day. Not going to be her,  not going to be her. And that's no way to attain the office. We got in there because Sleepy Joe couldn't handle it anymore. Joe is bad primetime. See,  the reason I can talk so badly about him,  because he did an ad,  where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago,  and they said … And nobody loves the military more. Look what I've done for them, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [ Well,  thank you to Vice President Pence. Thank you,  Mike. And hello Pennsylvania. Hello. It's great to be back in this state that gave us the Liberty Bell,  Pennsylvania Steel,  Hershey chocolate. I like Hershey chocolate. The Nittany Lions. The Nittany Lions,  they're doing pretty well too and the incredible American Patriots just like you,  you are Patriots. Thank you very much. Thank you. Under Republican leadership,  America is stronger than ever before and we are respected again. Last month you saw it,  we smashed expectations with another 266, 000 jobs and unemployment is now more than a 50-year low. We have never seen what's going on with different groups. Unemployment is at a position we've never had anything like this. You are so lucky I became your president. I'm only kidding. I have to say I'm kidding because the fake news back there will take that. They'll take that statement and they'll blow it up and they'll say,  \"He said they were lucky to have him as president. What a horrible thing to say.\" Because they're fake. Anyway,  here in Pennsylvania you had the single best year that you've ever had in the history of our country,  not bad. The Pennsylvania unemployment rate has reached an all time record low. And I hate to tell you this,  when I was campaigning three and a half years ago,  I'd come here,  you weren't doing so well,  folks. You weren't doing so well. Wages were way down,  unemployment was way up. It wasn't a pretty picture. Just a few months ago,  I visited the new Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County at $6 billion with a B,  $6 billion. It is the largest investment in Pennsylvania history. We're ending decades of failed trade policies that devastated communities all across the state. For generations,  American manufacturing was the bedrock of your economy,  the bedrock. Remember the last administration,  \" You need a magic wand. It'll never come back.\" We found the magic wand,  didn't we? Then came NAFTA,  the NAFTA disaster,  I call it,  one of the worst trade deals in the history of any country and the loss of one in three Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs. Your politicians always pledged to fix it. They'd talk about it for years and years and decades,  but they never were able to do it. They came and they went to Washington and they did nothing. But unlike those politicians,  I keep my promises. And I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania,  you know that right? I know it well. And I'm thrilled to report that we are on the verge of ending the NAFTA catastrophe once and for all. Congress will soon vote on my new trade deal,  the US-Mexico-Canada agreement or USMCA. After years of waiting,  many,  many years,  many.1,  many decades,  they've been looking for this,  and then we got it done and we've been waiting for a long time for Nancy Pelosi to announce USMCA and she did it on the same day that they announced that they are going to impeach the 45th president of the United States and your favorite president,  I think. And the reason they announced it on the same day,  one hour later,  they announce impeachment,  a few guys standing behind her. They announced the impeachment,  and then an hour later,  she announced that she's going to USMCA. You know why? It's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment,  and our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment. And think of it this way also,  the silver lining of impeachment and this witch hunt,  that's the reason they approved USMCA. So that's okay with me,  because they approved it and they're very happy to have it. But honestly,  it's an incredible deal for our country. Took too long,  it waited in Congress for too long a time. Incredible deal,  and replacing the worst,  NAFTA. We've also just reached a deal with Congress to invest a record $738 billion more into our great military. When I took over,  I will tell you,  I became president… Think of it,  almost three years ago. By the way,  was that the most exciting night ever? I'm just watching these people,  that was one of the greatest evenings in the history of television from a rating standpoint,  from an excitement standpoint,  what the hell would they do without me and you? They'd be gone. About a month before I ran,  I picked up a New York Times,  it was like a leaflet that you had out at a grocery store and now it's thick. They've got all their reporters covering Trump,  Trump,  Trump. I can't imagine they won't endorse because without me winning,  you know what happens? They all go down the tombs they got,  all of them,  Washington Post,  New York Times,  those very dishonest networks. They are very dishonest,  very,  very dishones. No,  they're very dishonest people. And I have to say this,  look,  and I always have to say this,  you have some really great journalists and you have some honest publications,  but not too many of them,  I have to be honest with you. Well,  you know that. Does anybody think the media is honest? Does anybody think they're totally corrupted and dishonest? All right. The legislation will also officially establish something that's so important to me because it's where it's at. And a lot of people used to smile and now outside of the wall,  which we're building… The wall is going on. It gets one of the biggest applause of anything,  it's the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces,  the Space Force. We're opening up the Space Force because you know what,  that's where it's at. And everything's built right here in the United States. That's simple. And by the way,  we build the greatest weapons,  the greatest planes,  the greatest ships,  we build it in the United States,  there's nobody that comes close. We have the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world,  rockets and missiles,  no place builds it like us. We have the best in the world and we sell it to allies and they all want to buy from the United States. We've never had a thing like this. We are so hot. We are so hot. And just a few weeks ago,  the United States Special Forces brought the world's number one terrorist to justice. Thanks to the strength and courage of our warriors,  and they're great warriors,  the bloodthirsty savage known as Al Baghdadi is now dead. And he was quickly replaced by his second-in-command and his second-in-command is now dead. And we've got our eye on and our sights on third also,  we know exactly where and when,  but it's becoming a very unpopular job,  not a lot of takers and that's what we want. Go back to living a good normal life because America is winning again. America is winning again like never before. And as I always say,  and I've already said it twice tonight,  this country is so respected and we were not respected four years ago,  we were laughed at. But while we're delivering historic victories for the American people,  the radical left Democrats and the failed Washington establishment are trying to erase your votes,  nullify the election and overthrow our democracy. Not going to happen,  don't worry about it. I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it. And I have to say this about the Republicans,  the Republicans… And you have a lot of great ones here tonight, ...]\n",

      "Columns: [Well,  thank you very much. And hello Las Vegas. Great to be with you. They have a big election tomorrow. We've already won the state. We've already won. I like ours better. We just take it. Just take it. We've won it. I like it that better. You know they say they're going to have a lot of problems tomorrow. I hate to tell you this. I don't know. Have you heard? I hear their computers are all messed up. Just like they were in Iowa. They're not going to be able to count their vote. They're going to tell you about healthcare. They're going to tell you about our military and the jet fighters and the missiles and rockets,  but they can't count votes. They just can't count them. They can't count votes,  but they're saying they may not be able to do it again. They're still trying to tell us. I called up yesterday,  how are they doing in Iowa? Was that two weeks ago? They say we're getting close. They're not getting close,  they'll never know. They'll never know,  but I hear the same thing could happen tomorrow. I hope it doesn't,  actually. I hope it doesn't,  but I'm delighted to be back in a state I love. I have a beautiful building right down the road. With the proud,  hardworking patriots of Nevada. You're going to say Nevada. You say that wrong,  you got problems. You say Nevada,  they go,  what the hell? Got to be Nevada. With your help this November,  we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Nevada in a big beautiful landslide. Now,  we have some special people here,  you know the special very special people. And we celebrate one of the greatest moments in the history of sports. Some people say it was the single greatest moment in the history of sports. It was called the miracle on ice. Do you remember that? That was when the Russians had a team assembled. That was probably,  they say maybe the greatest team ever assembled. They were unbelievable. And our guys played a practice game with them was it a couple of weeks before,  and I hate to tell you the score was 10 to 3,  and the USA was not on top,  and this team was an incredible team and they went in and it was amazing,  but tomorrow marks the 40 years since the United States men's hockey team defeated then Soviet Union team in the 1980 Olympics. Incredible. That was incredible. Most of you remember that. I'm looking. We've got a lot of young ones,  but we've got a lot of people that remember that. A lot of people. And by the way,  we got the Olympics coming back or coming to Los Angeles. Thank you. Thank you President Trump. Thank you President Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you President Trump. Eight years. Eight years,  2028 you know what? Unless I'm still president then,  which is a distinct possibility,  I won't be here,  and you know what they'll do? I'll say,  how's the Olympics going? Does anybody have a ticket for the president that got the Olympics to come here? They'll say,  I want to thank and they'll thank hundreds of people,  but they won't thank you president that I'm the one that pulled it off. But that's okay. 2028 Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. It's going to be great. And we worked with the mayor of Los Angeles. He was great. He called up and we gave him a lot of help. I was president elect then because the president didn't want to get involved. He didn't want to get involved in getting the Olympics,  so they called me and I was president elect,  hadn't taken office. Then I got involved and I'll tell you,  they were happy we got involved. It was great. It's going to be very exciting today. We are thrilled to have with us 14 players of that really incredible gold medal team. Give him a big hand. And they were amazed. They said,  boy is a big crowd. I said,  it's only because you guys are coming. This day was supposed to be for this evening. And I said,  let me get back to Washington,  do it early. So we gave you almost no notice. You have thousands of people outside,  thousands of people inside. You had to see,  we were in Iowa we were in New Hampshire. You saw what happened in Colorado last. That was unbelievable. Every place we go it's the same. It's been incredible. I don't know if you saw the pictures last night of the outside in Colorado. It was incredible. It was. You could have filled that arena up four times and it was a big arena,  and it's something. So I hated to do it to you at 12 o'clock but I said,  let's go. I want to get back. We got to deal with China. We got to deal with Russia. We got to deal with North Korea,  South Korea. We got to deal with the rest of the world. Get my people back. We got to get the hell out of here,  right? But we have a lot of time. I'd like now to invite these incredible sport legends to join me on stage. A friend of mine and a very good golfer,  by the way,  Captain Mike he rode a bike. Mike. Where's Mike? Where is he? Mike. Do you know who he is? He's a fake handicap is what he is. Say something Mike. Just welcome everybody to ironic we happen to be here to celebrate our 40th anniversary,  the Vegas Knights flew the whole team out to honor us tonight and for the weekend and we obviously thank the people of Las Vegas for having us here and we're looking forward to celebrating a special time,  and it's a great honor for the president to invite us to be part of this event as well. So Vegas,  thanks for having us. But just tell them,  am I a good athlete and am I a good golfer? Thanks Mike. That was some goaltending right? How many did you rebuff? I mean,  but how many did Jim have? Many did. Very few. But a lot of shots,  right? He was like a pinata. So Mike,  that was great. Goaltender Jim Craig. So Jim rebuffed come here,  Jim. Great goaltender,  great goaltender. They didn't know what was happening. They kept shooting. He doesn't know how many you rebuffed. How many did you rebuff? 37. So let me ask you,  was that as goaltender,  because that was incredible. Was that the greatest game you ever played? You've had a lot of great games. But was that the greatest game you've ever played? It was slightly important. 37. 37. Bill Baker. Bill,  come up. Bill Baker. Dave Christian,  Ken Morrow,  Jack O'Callahan,  Mike Ramsey. Those legs took a beating. Mark Wells,  Neil Brotton,  John Harrington,  Rob McClanahan,  Buzz Schneider,  Dave Silk,  Phil Verchota,  and a great coach and assistant coach at the time,  Craig Patrick. They said four more years,  12 more years left for them. Look at that. Look at the press. Hey Mike,  look at the fake news back there. It's a lot. I always say that's like the Academy Awards used to be. This year,  we had a movie,  they said best movie,  they announced the movie from South Korea. I said,  what's that all about? The movie was made in South Korea. Look,  I get along great with South Korea,  but you know,  I never saw that one before. They used to go best foreign movie,  but now we do it that way. I don't get it,  but that's what it used to be and this is really an incredible time. I'll tell you what,  for our country,  that's why I like to see things that we do get honored because nobody is doing what we do. Nobody can do it like us. We're the greatest country in the world again. We have the greatest people. We have the greatest military by far. We've totally rebuilt our military. Jobs are booming,  incomes are surging,  poverty is plummeting. Factories are returning confidence is soaring,  like these guys,  the confidence is soaring,  but you know.1,  we do have somebody that I'd like to point out because this team is,  they had a coach,  and that coach was a very inspirational coach,  would you say Mike? And I'd like to have maybe one of you come up and just say a few words about Coach Brooks because he was very,  very,  he was really a big,  he was a big heart on this team. Please. Say something. So tell me one thing,  one thing. So I see those tears. That means you think,  you miss him and you love him. Right? Was he actually a nice guy? Because he looked tough. Mike was just saying he was brutal,  but he was a good guy,  right? Tough but great. Thank you very much. Thanks Kelly. Thank you all. Greatest sports story could be number one. So a lot of people,  a lot of these sports experts,  sports writers have voted that as the single greatest sporting event or athletic achievement. I think so,  yeah? They put it number one, ...]\n",
