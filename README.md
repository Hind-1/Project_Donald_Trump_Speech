Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents 

The purpose of this project is to carry out NLP analysis of Donald Trump's Twitter. 
Our goal is to identify	What is the overall sentiment of Trump's tweets, and how has it changed over time? and what are some defining features of Trump's behavior on Twitter, and how can we visualize them?.
